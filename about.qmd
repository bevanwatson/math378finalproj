**Dataset**

![](images/palmerpenguinslogo-03.png)

The exploratory data analysis and predictive model were built using the "palmerpenguins" dataset. The full documentation and reference for the dataset [can be found here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). Feature of the datset are explored on the Penguins EDA tab.

**EDA Methods**

I started with the code provided in the labs by Alex Gold in [DevOps for Data Science]((https://do4ds.com/). I augmented his EDA code with methods found in ["R for Data Science"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), as well as techniques taught in DATA364.

**Modeling Methods**

As with EDA, I started with the code provided in DO4DS. I build more models based on exercises from MATH378 and "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" with Applications in Python.
